# 2022-Channyung-Ga2O3-EPR
Generated and analyzed data repository for Electron-phonon effects and temperature-dependence of the electronic structure of monoclinic beta-gallium oxide.
# Files
A. POSCAR files (a plain text file containing the lattice geometry and the ionic positions) of beta-gallium oxide at high temperatures
  1) POSCAR files with thermal expansions only
  2) POSCAR files with thermal expansions and lattice vibrations

B. PARCHG files (the partial charge densities) of conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) states at high temperatures

C. POSCAR files at high temperatures with vacuum slabs for band alignment calculations

D. Planar averaged LOCPOT files (the averaged sum of local ionic potential and the Hartree potential along a-axis) at high temperatures for band alignment calculations

E. Others
  1) Electronic band structure of the primitive cell of beta-gallium oxide
  2) Phonon band structure of the primitive cell of beta-gallium oxide
  3) Thermal expansion data from quasiharmonic approximations
